                <p>Arizona is a state in the Southwest of the United States. It is known as the copper state and produces a large amount of copper to this day. While hot in the Summer Arizona is the place to be during the Winter months and makes for a great place to live. Arizona is also the home of the Grand Canyon through which the Colorado River flows.</p>
